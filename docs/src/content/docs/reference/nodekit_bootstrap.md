## Synopsis                                                  
                                                                                                         
                                                                                                         
Initialize a fresh node                                                                                  
                                                                                                         
Overview:                                                                                                
Get up and running with a fresh Algorand node.                                                           
Uses the local package manager to install Algorand, and then starts the node and performs a Fast-Catchup.
                                                                                                         
Note: This command only supports the default data directory, /var/lib/algorand
